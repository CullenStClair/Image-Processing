```

## Usage

List all available operations

```bash

```

Show arguments for a given operation

```bash
  python src/main.py <in-file-path> <out-file-name> <operation> -h
```

Example: Crop `/img-editor/tests/images/logo.png` to within corners (100, 100) and (300, 300)

```bash
  python src/main.py tests/images/logo.png out.png crop 100 100 300 300
