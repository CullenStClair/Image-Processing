```

Go to the project directory "Image-Processing"

```bash
  cd Image-Processing
```

Install dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

List all available operations

```bash
  python main.py --help
```

Show usage and details for a given operation

```bash

```

### Example

Rotate `C:\Downloads\logo.png` by 180 degrees and save as `C:\Downloads\flipped.png`
